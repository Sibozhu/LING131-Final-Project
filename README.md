# LING131-Final-Project

This is the repository for the LING131 final project.

"presentation_slides.pptx" is the slide we used for our course presentation.

"LING131\_Project\_Report.pdf" is our final report our this course project.

This repository contains three directories:

# To Run 

It is a directory in which we place the Jupyter Notebook file "LING131 Final Project(Team rm -rf).ipynb" which contains all the code we are using in this project.

Due to the fact that all the actual datasets are exclusive in the Kaggle server and can only access through the competition kernel, after consulting and agreed by Professor Verhagen, we can just give you all the code we are using and the screenshot showing that our code successfully passed the Kaggle server(Took roughly 6 hours to run the code on Kaggle server).

However, we strongly recommend whoever read this report to join the competition as well and test run our code in your private kernel.

"coderun1.png" and "coderun2.png" show that our code passed and successfully run through the Kaggle server.

# What Didn't Work

It is the directory in which we place all our attempts on feature engineering, selections and boosting algorithms. Also, you can only run them on the Kaggle competition kernel.
